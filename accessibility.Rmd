## Compliance
These web pages were reviewed by an internal accessibility expert in June 2020.

### Current issues we are working to fix
* Graphics in the visual summary do not have alt text
* Graphics in the visual summary are not arranged well for screen readers
* Some charts in the detailed analysis contain text that is difficult for people using screen readers to access
* Some of the links in the page navigation are not available to keyboard users
* Some text does not appear in high contrast mode - mostly annotations and tooltips within charts
